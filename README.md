# Mail-Order-CSharp
Created a  C# Application in a scenario where a company has instituted a bonus program to give its employees and incentive to sell more. For every dollar the store makes in a four-week period, the employees receive 2% of sales. The amount of bonus each employee receives is based upon the percentage of hours they worked during the bonus., a total of 160 hours.
